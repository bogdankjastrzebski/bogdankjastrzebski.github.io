# Topology, Fibers and Optimization [WORKLOG]

The following is a short description of topological fiber bundles, and a cute application in mathematical optimization.

# Definitions

A **topological fiber bundle** is a quadruple $(E, B, \pi, F)$ consisting of:

1.  A **total space** $E$, which is a topological space.
2.  A **base space** $B$, which is a topological space.
3.  A **projection map** $\pi: E \to B$, which is a continuous and surjective map.
4.  A **fiber** $F$, which is a topological space (the "model fiber").

These components must satisfy the **local triviality condition**:

For every point $b \in B$, there exists an open neighborhood $U \subseteq B$ of $b$ and a **homeomorphism** $\Phi: \pi^{-1}(U) \to U \times F$ such that the following diagram commutes:

```

π⁻¹(U)  ───────→  U × F
|                 |
| π               | pr₁
↓                 ↓
U  ────────────→  U
          id_U
```

Here:
* $\pi^{-1}(U) = \{e \in E \mid \pi(e) \in U\}$ is the portion of the total space lying above $U$.
* $\text{pr}_1: U \times F \to U$ is the canonical projection onto the first factor, defined by $\text{pr}_1(u, f) = u$.
* $\text{id}_U$ is the identity map on $U$.

The commutativity condition $\text{pr}_1 \circ \Phi = \pi|_{\pi^{-1}(U)}$ means that for any $e \in \pi^{-1}(U)$, if $\Phi(e) = (u, f)$, then $u = \pi(e)$. This ensures that $\Phi$ maps the fiber over $u$ in $E$ homeomorphically to $\{u\} \times F$ in the product space, locally identifying $E$ with a product space.
